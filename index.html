            Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Horde3D is a small open source 3D rendering engine. It is written in an effort to
            create a graphics engine that offers the stunning visual effects expected in next-generation
            games while at the same time being as lightweight and conceptually clean as possible.
            Horde3D has a simple and intuitive interface accessible from virtually any programming
            language and is particularly suitable for rendering large crowds of animated characters
            in next-generation quality.

        <br />
        <p>
			After a long period of SVN updates without any release packages, the <a href="download.html">Beta5 release</a> is
			finally out and brings a plenty of bug fixes and performance improvements. On the core engine side, there are several
			updates to the shader system which remove all fixed-function dependencies. Besides that, several smaller enhancements
			to overlays, particle systems, animations and in-game profiling were done.<br/>
			ColladaConv got an important update and supports batch processing of input files now, so that a whole asset repository
			can be recompiled automatically. Moreover, the parsing speed was improved by using a faster XML parser and
			applying various other optimizations.

           of smaller changes and improvements the resource manager was updated to support reloading of resources.
           <br/><br/>
		   Besides the new release there are some other great news: Two weeks ago Horde has won the IVA GALA award where

		<h3>Horde3D SDK [0.10.0] with flexible rendering pipeline <i>[2007-04-30]</i></h3>
        <p>
           The latest version of Horde3D features a completely rewritten renderer. Besides some heavy performance
           optimizations to reduce call overhead, a flexible and configurable rendering pipeline
           has been introduced. The engine offers the possibility to define render targets and fill them with
           data using a simple XML syntax. These targets can be bound in subsequent rendering steps
           making it possible to do a plenty of post processing effects. Thanks to the new rendering
           architecture it is also possible now to use standard forward rendering instead of the
           deferred shading which was default up to the previous version. Additionally the release
           brings a plenty of bugfixes and smaller improvements. The camera is represented as a scene
           node now and the animation system was extended with a very convenient additive blending mode. Head
           to the <a href="download.html">download section</a> to grab the new release!

		<h3>Horde3D SDK [0.9.0] with advanced animation system <i>[2007-03-04]</i></h3>
        <p>
           The latest version of Horde brings a completely new animation system. It is possible now
           to use layered blending and mixing with masks in order to apply several animations to a model.
           Smoother animations for joints and rigid mehses can be achieved using inter-frame interpolation.
           Furthermore the engine now offers access to the joint data which makes it possible to
           apply dynamic animations or ragdoll physics. All scene nodes are fully hierarchical and thus
           it is possible to attach objects to joints. Besides these changes the engine received some
           improvements to the API which make the interface more flexible and intuitive to use. For more details

           some modifications have been made to the scene management. Joints are part of the scene graph now and
           new functions were introduced which give access to the vertex data for collision detection or integration
           of a physics engine. Furthermore many functions were added to retrieve object states and Horde3D can now be
           used for AR applications thanks to a dynamic texture update function. Finally the compatibility of the
